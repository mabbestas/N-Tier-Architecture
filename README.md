# What Is N-Tier Architecture?
Multi-tier architecture can help you build more secure, flexible, and easy to manage software through more efficient development.

N-tier architecture is also called multi-tier architecture because the software is engineered to have the processing, data management, and presentation functions physically and logically separated.  That means that these different functions are hosted on several machines or clusters, ensuring that services are provided without resources being shared and, as such, these services are delivered at top capacity. The “N” in the name n-tier architecture refers to any number from 1.

Not only does your software gain from being able to get services at the best possible rate, but it’s also easier to manage. This is because when you work on one section, the changes you make will not affect the other functions.  And if there is a problem, you can easily pinpoint where it originates.


## Why do we need n-tier architecture?

The n-tier architecture is an industry-proven software architecture model. It is suitable to support enterprise level client-server applications by providing solutions to scalability, security, fault tolerance, reusability, and maintainability. It helps developers to create flexible and reusable applications.

## Types of N-Tier Architectures

### 3-Tier Architecture

- **The application logic tier:** The application logic tier is where all the “thinking” happens, and it knows what is allowed by your application and what is possible, and it makes other decisions.  This logic tier is also the one that writes and reads data into the data tier.

- **The data tier:** The data tier is where all the data used in your application are stored.  You can securely store data on this tier, do transactions, and even search through volumes and volumes of data in a matter of seconds.

- **The presentation tier:** The presentation tier is the user interface.  This is what the software user sees and interacts with. This is where they enter the needed information.  This tier also acts as a go-between for the data tier and the user, passing on the user’s different actions to the logic tier.

### 4-Tier Architecture

While the most widespread use of multi-tier architecture is 3-tier architecture, in the book Domain Driven Design there are 4 layers which are the presentation layer, the application layer, the business layer, and the data access layer.

The presentation layer means the layer of UI (user interface) or view layer. It may be built with different technologies like Razor pages, Blazor, or modern web libraries and frameworks like Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

The application layer is also known as the service layer or GRASP controller layer.

The business layer is also known as the business logic layer (BLL) or domain logic layer. This is where the logical part of the application happens like calculations, CRUD (create-read-update-delete) operations, data analysis, etc.

The data access layer is where the entities live and it is simply a model of the database like in the Model-View-Controller pattern. This is actually the reason why we call it a model since it is the model of the database.

### 2-Tier Architecture

It is like Client-Server architecture, where communication takes place between client and server.

In this type of software architecture, the presentation layer or user interface layer runs on the client side while dataset layer gets executed and stored on server side.

There is no Business logic layer or immediate layer in between client and server.

### Single Tier or 1-Tier Architecture

It is the simplest one as it is equivalent to running the application on the personal computer. All of the required components for an application to run are on a single application or server.

Presentation layer, Business logic layer, and data layer are all located on a single machine.

## What Are the Benefits of N-Tier Architecture?

There are several benefits to using n-tier architecture for your software.  These are scalability, ease of management, flexibility, and security.

- **Secure:** You can secure each of the three tiers separately using different methods.
- **Easy to manage:** You can manage each tier separately, adding or modifying each tier without affecting the other tiers.
- **Scalable:** If you need to add more resources, you can do it per tier, without affecting the other tiers.
- **Flexible:** Apart from isolated scalability, you can also expand each tier in any manner that your requirements dictate.

In short, with n-tier architecture, you can adopt new technologies and add more components without having to rewrite the entire application or redesigning your whole software, thus making it easier to scale or maintain. Meanwhile, in terms of security, you can store sensitive or confidential information in the logic tier, keeping it away from the presentation tier, thus making it more secure.

Other benefits include:

**More efficient development:** N-tier architecture is very friendly for development, as different teams may work on each tier.  This way, you can be sure the design and presentation professionals work on the presentation tier and the database experts work on the data tier.

**Easy to add new features:** If you want to introduce a new feature, you can add it to the appropriate tier without affecting the other tiers.

**Easy to reuse:** Because the application is divided into independent tiers, you can easily reuse each tier for other software projects.  For instance, if you want to use the same program, but for a different data set, you can just replicate the logic and presentation tiers and then create a new data tier.

## Challenges of N-tier architecture

**Increased cost:**
Every tier involved in a software application requires more hardware, deployment, and maintenance needs, each of which can increase costs. Thus, it's a good idea to minimize the number of tiers within the software system. Limiting to three tiers can help lower costs while providing the advantages mentioned above.

**Slower performance:**
More networks and devices linked to the system require a larger number of tiers, which can result in the slow performance of the application, particularly if the network bandwidth and hardware specifications aren't high enough. To mitigate or resolve this challenge, it's important to ensure that you maintain a fast network and capable machines. This can ensure that you get the most value out of your N-tier software.
